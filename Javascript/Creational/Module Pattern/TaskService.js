// Module pattern implementation using closures
'use strict';

// Create and annonymous closure containing public and private methods  or properties 
// Javascript doesn't have private keywords for methods or properties
// Thus, to achieve encapsulation and maintain the state across objects closures are used
// As a convention, all private properties & methods are prefixed with underscore(_)


var TaskService = (function(){

    // Let say this class fetches tasks data from DB before completing the task






}());
